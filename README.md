## How it's work ?
  * Use the key file to enter inside the deferents keys needed bellow the sections seperated by a '#'
     * first : CONSUMER_KEY
     * second : CONSUMER_SECRET
     * third : ACCESS_TOKEN
     * fourth : ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
  * The final result should be something like :
       \# CONSUMER_KEY

       \# CONSUMER_SECRET

       \# ACCESS_TOKEN

       \# ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
